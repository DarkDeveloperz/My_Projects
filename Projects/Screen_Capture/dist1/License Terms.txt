DeveloperAK SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
Screen Capture
These license terms are an agreement between you and
•	the computer manufacturer that distributes the software with the computer, or
•	the software installer that distributes the software with the computer.
Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. Printed-paper license terms, which may come with the software take the place of any on-screen license terms. These terms also apply to any Microsoft
•	updates,
•	supplements,
•	Internet-based services, and
•	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those other terms apply.
If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Microsoft, Microsoft, and not the manufacturer or installer, licenses those to you.
By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you to return the entire system on which the software is installed.
As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of certain computer information during activation, validation and for Internet-based services.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.
1.	OVERVIEW.
a.	Software. The software includes desktop operating system software. This software does not include Windows Live services. Windows Live services are available from Microsoft under a separate agreement.
b.	License Model. The software is licensed on a per copy per computer basis. A computer is a physical hardware system with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate computer.
2.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a.	One Copy per Computer. The software license is permanently assigned to the computer with which the software is distributed. That computer is the “licensed computer.”
b.	Licensed Computer. You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed computer at one time. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, you may not use the software on any other computer.
c.	Number of Users. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, only one user may use the software at a time on the licensed computer.
d.	Alternative Versions. The software may include more than one version, such as 32-bit and 64-bit. You may use only one version at one time. If the manufacturer or installer provides you with a one-time selection between language versions, you may use only the one language version you select.
3.	ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a.	Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use to
•	pool connections, or
•	reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software
(sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses you need.
b.	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only
•	embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
•	temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.
c.	Icons, Images and Sounds. While the software is running, you may use but not share its icons, images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the software are for your non-commercial use only.
d.	Use with Virtualization Technologies. Instead of using the software directly on the licensed computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system on the licensed computer. When used in a virtualized environment, content protected by digital rights management technology, BitLocker or any full volume disk drive encryption technology may not be as secure as protected content not in a virtualized environment. You should comply with all domestic and international laws that apply to such protected content.
e.	Device Connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access software installed on the licensed computer to use only File Services, Print Services, Internet Information Services and Internet Connection Sharing and Telephony Services.
f.	Remote Access Technologies. You may remotely access and use the software installed on the licensed computer from another computer to share a session using Remote Assistance or similar technologies. A “session” means the experience of interacting with the software, directly or indirectly, through any combination of input, output and display peripherals.
4.	MANDATORY ACTIVATION.
Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. During activation, the software will send information about the software and the computer to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the computer, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104609. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for activation. This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation. If the computer is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. The software will remind you to activate it until you do.
5.	VALIDATION.
a.	Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. You are not permitted to circumvent validation. This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.
b.	The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a validation check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during or after a validation check, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611.
c.	If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, or a non-genuine Windows product, or if it includes unauthorized changes, then the functionality and experience of using the software will be affected. For example:
Microsoft may
•	repair the software, and remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may interfere with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or validation functions of the software; or
•	check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such unauthorized changes; or
•	provide notice that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product;
and you may
•	receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software; or
•	need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate;
and you may not be able to
•	use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software; or
•	obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft.
d.	You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.
6.	POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE. If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe,” will automatically be removed after scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software may result in
•	other software on your computer ceasing to work, or
•	your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.
By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially unwanted software.
7.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.
a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the Windows 7 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows 7 Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104604. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of the information described below. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
•	Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. You may connect new hardware to your computer, either directly or over a network. Your computer may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your computer. An administrator can disable this update feature.
•	Windows Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update service in the software (if you use it), updates or downloads to the Windows Update service will be required from time to time and downloaded and installed without further notice to you.
•	Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.
•	Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.
•	Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.
•	Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the software may check for and remove certain malware from your computer. “Malware” is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.
•	Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.
•	Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses the standard NTP protocol.
•	IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is the next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service information to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you
•	use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity, or
•	configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity,
Then, by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named “netsh”.
b.	Use of Information. Microsoft may use the computer information, accelerator information, search suggestions information, error reports, and Malware reports to improve our software and services. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
c.	Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
8.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the features included in the software edition you licensed. The manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
•	work around any technical limitations in the software;
•	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
•	use components of the software to run applications not running on the software;
•	make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
•	publish the software for others to copy;
•	rent, lease or lend the software; or
•	use the software for commercial software hosting services.
9.	NOTICE REGARDING THE ABSENCE OF INTERNET EXPLORER 8 AND WINDOWS MEDIA FUNCTIONALITY. The software does not include Internet Explorer 8 or Windows Media Player (as defined by the European Commission) and Windows Media Player related technologies such as Windows Media Center and Windows DVD Maker.
