You might not be able to run this project because its entire database is saved in my computer.
The database was created in mysql server and this software runs on local machine.
I dont know how to upload its database thats why i am not uploading the database.

I am attaching a .doc file which shows the UI and working of this software.

I can show the demo if we meet in person.

Its not a simple library management software its much more than that and have much more features.
I request you to give me a chance to show you this awesome project and have a look at its UI and database.

Thanks!!
